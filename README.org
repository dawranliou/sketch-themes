#+TITLE:Sketch Themes

A collection of almost monochrome Emacs themes in a couple of variants.

* Installation
** Use package
If you have use-package setup on your system loading sketch-themes is as
simple as:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package sketch-themes
    :config
    ;; Load black version
    ;;(load-theme 'sketch-black t)
    ;; Load white version
    (load-theme 'sketch-white t))

#+end_src

** Manual installation
If you prefer, you can install sketch-themes manually by downloading the
elisp files in this repo and place them somewhere in your
=custom-theme-load-path=.

You can set your =custom-theme-load-path= by adding this to your =.emacs.d= or
=.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")

#+end_src

You should now be able to load sketch-themes with ~M-x load-theme RET
sketch-{black, white}~!
