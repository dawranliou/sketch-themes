#+TITLE:Sketch Themes

[[https://melpa.org/#/sketch-themes][file:https://melpa.org/packages/sketch-themes-badge.svg]]

A collection of (almost) grayscale Emacs themes

* Introduction
A lot of my current philosophy about syntax highlighting went into my blog post
[[https://dawranliou.com/blog/rethink-syntax-highlighting/][Rethink Syntax Highlighting]]. The TL;DR is that I want my color themes to stay
minimal and to keep me focused. I used a couple of monochromatic themes in the
past, and most of them are good, such as [[https://github.com/maio/eink-emacs][eink]], [[https://github.com/voloyev/sexy-monochrome-theme][sexy-monochrome]]. The ones that I
like the most are the [[https://github.com/cryon/almost-mono-themes][almost mono themes]]. The sketch themes are my take on the
almost mono themes.

* Installation
** Use package
If you have use-package setup on your system loading sketch-themes is as
simple as:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package sketch-themes
    :config
    ;; Load black version
    ;;(load-theme 'sketch-black t)
    ;; Load white version
    (load-theme 'sketch-white t))

#+end_src

** Manual installation
If you prefer, you can install sketch-themes manually by downloading the
elisp files in this repo and place them somewhere in your
=custom-theme-load-path=.

You can set your =custom-theme-load-path= by adding this to your =.emacs.d= or
=.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")

#+end_src

You should now be able to load sketch-themes with ~M-x load-theme RET
sketch-{black, white}~!

* Credits
- A lot of the code and concepts were inspired by Github user [[https://github.com/cryon][@cryon]]'s [[https://github.com/cryon/almost-mono-themes][Almost
  Mono Themes]]. Huge thanks to him!

- Also thanks to [[https://twitter.com/Polyducks][Polyducks]]' [[https://lospec.com/palette-list/1bit-monitor-glow][1 Bit Monitor Glow Palette]] and to his suggestion on
  the highlighting colors.
